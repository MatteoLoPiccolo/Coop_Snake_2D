# Coop_Snake_2D
2D project for old game "snake"


This is a small project to create a sort of clone of 2D Snake on Unity.

In addition to the basic mechanic of the snake eating and growing larger, I've added another fruit that reduces the snake's size.
There's a small UI, a main menu, an end game screen with either player 1 or player 2 winning depending on the score, and obviously a restart.

For the random spawn, I used coroutines and had fun testing a couple of coroutines for the score UI as well.

I plan to polish the project and maybe add management through events or some pattern.

I'll keep you updated!

P.S. a couple of video about the project
